        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>
            We propose the development of CloudForest, a portable cyberinfrastructure workflow for addressing
            outstanding challenges in phylogenomics. CloudForest will provide researchers with a set of streamlined
            tools to explore and understand variation in evolutionary history across different regions of the genome
            (i.e., gene tree variation), leveraging computing resources that range from laptops, to HPC clusters, to
            cloud-based resources like JetStream or Amazon Web Services. CloudForest will meet many of the outstanding
            needs of empirical phylogenomic studies, such as (1) visualizing variation across gene trees, (2) revealing
            structure in sets of trees (forests), (3) conducting hypothesis tests regarding the causes of gene-tree
            variation, and (4) detecting genes that may have outlying (and potentially aberrant) histories. By
            addressing these challenges in a consistent way across computing platforms, CloudForest will allow
            biologists to make efficient use of any computational resources at their disposal with workflows appropriate
            for addressing a variety of important, unresolved questions in both evolutionary biology and other applied
            fields.
        </p>

        <h4>Intellectual Merit</h4>

        <p>
            Variation across inferred gene trees is arguably the most consistent and striking observation from empirical
            phylogenomic studies, yet many unanswered questions remain about the causes of this variation. One important
            reason these questions persist is because the field lacks robust, efficient, and reproducible workflows for
            investigating this variation. Currently, individual tools are not integrated with one another and are
            combined in an ad hoc manner. Further, these tools are not responsive to the varied computing resources
            available to today's researcher. With enormous and diverse genomic datasets now the norm in phylogenetics,
            powerful and flexible tools are sorely needed. CloudForest will greatly improve researchers' ability to
            handle phylogenetic "big data" in order to reconstruct evolutionary relationships and understand how
            evolution has shaped genomes.
        </p>

        <h4>Broader Impacts</h4>
        <p>
            This project will advance broader goals by (1) supporting broad educational and training opportunities for
            researchers from around the world in the use of advanced computing solutions, (2) actively promoting the
            involvement and achievements of researchers from underrepresented groups in computational biology, (3)
            providing unique, interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate students at the intersection of
            computing, math, and biology, (4) contributing to the development of an interactive and visually rich
            website for learning about phylogenetics and phylogenomics, and (5) facilitating applied phylogenetic
            research that will advance human health and well-being.
